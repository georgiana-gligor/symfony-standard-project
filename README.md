Simple command-line scripts to create a bare-bones Symfony2 project and make the first commit to GitHub.

Three OSes are currently supported, OS X, RedHat and Ubuntu.
A more general script is left as an exercise.
Here are some starting points:

* coto's shootProfile() https://github.com/coto/server-easy-install/blob/master/lib/core.sh
* [the Big Daddy OS detection](http://git.savannah.gnu.org/gitweb/?p=config.git;a=blob;f=config.guess;hb=HEAD)
